    "text": "When Stephen Nedoroscik’s flawless routine ringed in the bronze medal for the USA men’s gymnastics Olympic team, many took to social media to celebrate “Mr. Pommel Horse” and the single routine that pushed the USA onto the Olympic podium for the first time since 2008.\nThough it was Nedoroscik’s pommel horse specialty that sealed the deal, the third place honor wouldn’t have been possible without the consistency of all-around gymnasts Fred Richard and Paul Juda.\nThis brings us to an ongoing debate in gymnastics recruiting: Which type of gymnast is more valuable to a team— the highly specialized event specialist, or the all-around athlete who competes in every event? While specialists like Nedoroscik can make a game-changing impact in a single event, all-arounders contribute across the board.\nExamining data from the top 4 NCAA teams – Stanford, Oklahoma, Michigan, and Nebraska – in their post-season 2024 championship meets, let’s explore how both types of gymnasts contribute to their teams’ success and which one might be more crucial to a team’s overall performance.\n\n\nCode\n#|include: false\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nmgym &lt;- read_csv(\"2024MGYM - Sheet.csv\")\nrosters &lt;-read_csv(\"ROSTER - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nmgym$Event_Score &lt;- as.numeric(as.character(mgym$Event_Score))\n\nmgym &lt;- mgym |&gt;\n  mutate(Contribution_Percentage = (Event_Score / Team_Total_Score) * 100)\n\nspecialists &lt;- mgym |&gt;\n  filter(Classification == \"Specialist\")\n\nallarounders &lt;- mgym |&gt;\n  filter(Classification ==\"AA\")\n\naverages &lt;- mgym |&gt;\n  group_by(Event, Classification) |&gt; \n  summarize(Average_Score = mean(Event_Score, na.rm = TRUE))\n\ntotal_average_score &lt;- mgym |&gt;\n  group_by(Event) |&gt;\n  summarize(Total_Average_Score = mean(Team_Total_Score, na.rm = TRUE))\n\naverage_contributions &lt;- mgym |&gt;\n  group_by(Classification) |&gt;\n  summarize(Average_Percentage = mean(Contribution_Percentage, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nevent_contributions &lt;- mgym |&gt;\n  group_by(Event, Classification) |&gt;\n  summarize(Total_Contribution = sum(Contribution_Percentage, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nspecialist_avg_contribution &lt;- specialists |&gt;\n  group_by(Event) |&gt;\n  summarize(Average_Contribution = mean(Contribution_Percentage, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nallarounder_avg_contribution &lt;- allarounders |&gt;\n  group_by(Event) |&gt;\n  summarize(Average_Contribution = mean(Contribution_Percentage, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nclassification_count &lt;- rosters |&gt;\n  group_by(Classification) |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = n())\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclassification_count |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How common are event specialists and all-around gymnasts?\",\n    subtitle = \"In the top 4 NCAA men's gymnastics teams, there are a LOT of specialists.\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = \"By Meg Gross | Source: RoadToNationals\") |&gt;\n  \n   tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow common are event specialists and all-around gymnasts?\n\n\nIn the top 4 NCAA men's gymnastics teams, there are a LOT of specialists.\n\n\nClassification\nCount\n\n\n\n\nAA\n7\n\n\nSpecialist\n42\n\n\n\nBy Meg Gross | Source: RoadToNationals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly enough, event specialists are incredibly common. Each NCAA team has at least two athletes per event that specialize in only that event, or at most one more. All-around gymnasts are much harder to find, but does that equate to value?\n\n\nCode\nggplot(averages, aes(x = Event, y = Average_Score, fill = Classification)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge()) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Specialist\" = \"lightblue\", \"AA\" = \"blue\")) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(9, 15)) +  \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(9, 15, by = 1)) +  \n  labs(y = \"Average Score\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"What kind of gymnast scores higher on each event, on average?\", \n    subtitle = \"Though there's not much of a difference, all-around gymnasts do typically score higher.\",\n    caption=\"Source: RoadToNationals | By Meg Gross\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, color = \"gray50\"),  \n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 10, color = \"gray60\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn average scoring per event, all-around and event specialist gymnasts are pretty evenly matched, but all-around gymnasts do barely edge on getting higher average scores on just over half of the six events – where specialists make it count is on horizontal bar and pommel horse.\nWhere event specialists are perceived to be absolute masters on their respective events, they more often match up evenly, and if not lower, than all-arounders.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(mgym, aes(x = Event, y = Event_Score, fill = Classification)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Specialist\" = \"lightblue\", \"AA\" = \"blue\")) +\n  labs(y = \"Event Score\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Focusing on score distributions tells a slightly different story.\", \n    subtitle = \"All-Around gymnasts tend to vary way more on each event.\",\n    caption=\"Source: RoadToNationals | By Meg Gross\")+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, color = \"gray50\"),  \n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 10, color = \"gray60\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what about score distributions? The box plot above shows how specialists might have the edge over all-around competitors on certain events, especially on the pommel horse. This begs the question, are all-arounders really more consistent?\nAll-around scores vary much more, as seen by the longer boxes, compared to event specialists, indicating that at least on an event-by-event basis, specialists are much more reliable.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(mgym, aes(x = Event, y = Contribution_Percentage, fill = Classification)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"summary\", fun = \"mean\", position = position_dodge()) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Specialist\" = \"lightblue\", \"AA\" = \"blue\")) +\n  labs(y = \"Contribution Percentage (%)\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Who is contributing more to their team's total per event?\", \n    subtitle = \"Average contributions remain pretty balanced across the board.\",\n    caption=\"Source: RoadToNationals | By Meg Gross\")+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, color = \"gray50\"),  \n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 10, color = \"gray60\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeither all-arounders nor specialists show clear dominance in boosting team performance on individual events.\nObviously, in the grand scheme of team scores, a pommel horse specialist with an flawless routine can’t possible contribute more in total than an all-around gymnast competing in six events for the team.\nWhile all-arounders might contribute slightly higher average scores and offer the consistency of competing across all events, specialists bring a focused precision that can give teams the edge in crucial meet-winning moments.\nBut when it comes to recruiting these gymnasts, the debate between event specialists and all-arounders maybe isn’t about choosing one over the other, but about recognizing their unique contributions. Specialists like Nedoroscik can deliver game-changing performances when it matters most, providing a level of reliability in high-stakes events like pommel horse. On the other hand, all-around gymnasts are indispensable for their versatility and consistency across multiple events, serving as the backbone of a team’s total score.\nWhether you’re recruiting for the next NCAA title or seeking a historic win on the biggest stage in sports, it’s not about choosing between specialists and all-arounders, but rather building a team where both types of gymnasts can thrive and contribute to their fullest potential."
