    "text": "Nebraska fans were filled with optimism coming into the 2024 football season. With a promising quarterback, superstar talent surrounding him, and a clean slate for coach Matt Rhule, the Husker offense finally seemed to be clicking. Opening the season with three straight wins, the future was looking bright for the Big Red.\nBut then, that momentum crashed. It seemed the positive changes to the offense had disappeared, and Husker fans are left wondering what all is going wrong for their team. Following a three-game losing streak against a few (potentially beatable) teams, it became clear that some kind of change had to be made.\nThe calls for a new offense weren’t simply a product of frustration from fans; The Huskers were ranking among the worst in several offensive statistics.\n\n\nCode\n#|include: false\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(waffle)\nWhereNURanks &lt;- read_csv(\"HolgersonVsNebraska - WhereNURanks.csv\")\nStat_Comparison &lt;- read_csv(\"HolgersonVsNebraska - Stat_Comparison.csv\")\nNUvsAvgDana &lt;- read_csv(\"HolgersonVsNebraska - NUvsAvgDana.csv\")\n\nWhereNURanks &lt;- WhereNURanks |&gt;\n  select(PPG,TotalPoints,RushingYPG,TotalYPG, RedZoneScorePct)\n\nnu &lt;- c(\"Red Zone Scores\"=72, \"Red Zone Opportunities\"=28)\ndana &lt;- c(\"Red Zone Scores\"=87, \"Red Zone Opportunities\"=13)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#|include: false\nWhereNURanks |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    PPG = \"Points per Game\",\n    TotalPoints = \"Total Points\",\n    RushingYPG = \"Rushing Yards per Game\",\n    TotalYPG = \"Total Yards per Game\",\n    RedZoneScorePct = \"Red Zone Efficiency\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"So, what's wrong with Nebraska's offense?\",\n    subtitle = \"Out of 134 teams, the Huskers are BOMBING in their offensive rankings Yikes...\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Meg Gross  |  **Source:** cfbstats.com\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what's wrong with Nebraska's offense?\n\n\nOut of 134 teams, the Huskers are BOMBING in their offensive rankings Yikes...\n\n\nPoints per Game\nTotal Points\nRushing Yards per Game\nTotal Yards per Game\nRed Zone Efficiency\n\n\n\n\n97th\n99th\n99th\n94th\n118th\n\n\n\nBy: Meg Gross | Source: cfbstats.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska’s rushing attack is obviously ineffective, ranking 99th in the country on the run game – rushing nearly less than 130 yards per game this season. 118th out of 134 teams in their red zone efficiency is an obivous concern, with the team converting just 75.5% of red zone opportunities into scores. Nebraska also had a huge deficiency in scoring overall this season, ranking 99th in points per game. These issues make it clear that a change in offensive philosophy is necessary.\nThe Husker offense needed someone well-versed in offensive strategy, someone who could identify issues in the scheme and bring an different approach to their playbook. Enter Dana Holgerson.\nHolgerson had been considered for the role as offensive coordinator previously, but this time decided to take the opportunity because “[he] was bored.” An impressive win over the Wisconsin Badgers at home freed Nebraska fans from an eight-year bowl game drought and gave college football a glimpse of a Holgerson air-raid offense in the Big Ten.\nBut how equipped is Holgerson to address these problems on offense that seem to plague the Big Red every year? Let’s look into his history on the headset for the Houston Cougars.\n\n\nCode\n #| message: FALSE\n#| warning: FALSE\n#|include: false\n  ggplot(Stat_Comparison, aes(x = interaction(Team, Year), y = RushingYPG, fill = Team)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"How was the run game with Holgerson at Houston?\",\n       subtitle = \"His past seasons have been pretty similar to Nebraska's on with rushing yards.\",\n       caption = \"By: Meg Gross  |  Source: cfbstats.com\",\n       x = \"Team\",\n       y = \"Rushing Yards Per Game\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Nebraska\" = \"red\", \"Houston\" = \"gray\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, color = \"gray50\"),  \n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 10, color = \"gray60\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his first year calling plays for Houston, the Cougars were averaging nearly 200 yards per game on the ground. As years went on and Holgerson began implementing an air raid style, they didn’t run the ball as much, making their running game pretty similar to Nebraska’s. Many critics of Holgerson’s strategy believe an offense heavy with passing won’t work in a conference like the Big Ten, so addressing the run game is going to be a huge test of his success on the call for the Huskers.\n\n\nCode\n#|include: false\nggplot(Stat_Comparison, aes(x = Team, y = TotalPPG, group = Team, color = Team)) +\n  geom_point(size = 4) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Can Dana help the Huskers score?\",\n       subtitle = \"He was averaging way more points per game with the Cougars.\",\n       caption = \"By: Meg Gross | Source: cfbstats.com\",\n       x = \"Team\",\n       y = \"Total Points per Game\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Nebraska\" = \"red\", \"Houston\" = \"gray\")) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"), \n        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, color = \"gray50\"),\n        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 10, color = \"gray60\"),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=Stat_Comparison, \n    aes(y=TotalPPG, label=TotalPPG)\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking into scoring, Nebraska is not doing too hot. 23.8 average points per game definitely sheds light on the Huskers inability to move the ball downfield. Holgerson’s teams at Houston were averaging at least 30, even up to 36.1 points per game in his 2022 season. To be fair, this could be the result of a difference in conference, but it’s also clear that Holgerson knows how to adjust his playbook to get his guys to the endzone. In the 2021 season, the Cougars were winning games by an average of 15.4 points. The Huskers could definitely use a guy who can kill the curse of losing one-score games.\n\n\nCode\n#|include: false\niron(\n waffle(nu, \n        rows = 10, \n        title=\"Nebraska in the Red Zone\", \n        colors = c(\"red\", \"snow2\"))+ \n   labs(\n     x=\"Nebraska\",\n     title=\"Nebraska vs Dana: In the Red Zone\", \n     subtitle=\"Dana is more efficient when it counts.\") + \n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  ),\n waffle(dana, \n        rows = 10, \n        colors = c(\"red\", \"snow2\")) + \n   labs(\n     x = \"Dana's Offenses\",\n     caption=\"By Meg Gross | Source: cfbstats.com\"\n     )\n) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, color = \"gray50\"),  \n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 10, color = \"gray60\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNULL\n\n\nBut where the Huskers REALLY need it is in the Red Zone. 118th out of 134 in capitalizing on opportunities to score is… not great, to say the very least. Nebraska turns just 75% of their red zone opportunities into points. At Houston, Holgerson was averaging about 87%. Much much better.\nRealistically, Holgerson hasn’t been able to completely restructure the offense in the end of the season, and who knows what version of an air-raid style would work best for the Huskers in the Big Ten, but it’s safe to say he’s a good guy for the job. With a historic bowl game underway and a young quarterback with a year of experience taking snaps, he’s got the tools and the knowledge to hopefully bring some hope to Husker Nation."

    "text": "When Stephen Nedoroscik’s flawless routine ringed in the bronze medal for the USA men’s gymnastics Olympic team, many took to social media to celebrate “Mr. Pommel Horse” and the single routine that pushed the USA onto the Olympic podium for the first time since 2008.\nThough it was Nedoroscik’s pommel horse specialty that sealed the deal, the third place honor wouldn’t have been possible without the consistency of all-around gymnasts Fred Richard and Paul Juda.\nThis brings us to an ongoing debate in gymnastics recruiting: Which type of gymnast is more valuable to a team— the highly specialized event specialist, or the all-around athlete who competes in every event? While specialists like Nedoroscik can make a game-changing impact in a single event, all-arounders contribute across the board.\nExamining data from the top 4 NCAA teams – Stanford, Oklahoma, Michigan, and Nebraska – in their post-season 2024 championship meets, let’s explore how both types of gymnasts contribute to their teams’ success and which one might be more crucial to a team’s overall performance.\n\n\nCode\n#|include: false\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nmgym &lt;- read_csv(\"2024MGYM - Sheet.csv\")\nrosters &lt;-read_csv(\"ROSTER - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nmgym$Event_Score &lt;- as.numeric(as.character(mgym$Event_Score))\n\nmgym &lt;- mgym |&gt;\n  mutate(Contribution_Percentage = (Event_Score / Team_Total_Score) * 100)\n\nspecialists &lt;- mgym |&gt;\n  filter(Classification == \"Specialist\")\n\nallarounders &lt;- mgym |&gt;\n  filter(Classification ==\"AA\")\n\naverages &lt;- mgym |&gt;\n  group_by(Event, Classification) |&gt; \n  summarize(Average_Score = mean(Event_Score, na.rm = TRUE))\n\ntotal_average_score &lt;- mgym |&gt;\n  group_by(Event) |&gt;\n  summarize(Total_Average_Score = mean(Team_Total_Score, na.rm = TRUE))\n\naverage_contributions &lt;- mgym |&gt;\n  group_by(Classification) |&gt;\n  summarize(Average_Percentage = mean(Contribution_Percentage, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nevent_contributions &lt;- mgym |&gt;\n  group_by(Event, Classification) |&gt;\n  summarize(Total_Contribution = sum(Contribution_Percentage, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nspecialist_avg_contribution &lt;- specialists |&gt;\n  group_by(Event) |&gt;\n  summarize(Average_Contribution = mean(Contribution_Percentage, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nallarounder_avg_contribution &lt;- allarounders |&gt;\n  group_by(Event) |&gt;\n  summarize(Average_Contribution = mean(Contribution_Percentage, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nclassification_count &lt;- rosters |&gt;\n  group_by(Classification) |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = n())\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclassification_count |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How common are event specialists and all-around gymnasts?\",\n    subtitle = \"In the top 4 NCAA men's gymnastics teams, there are a LOT of specialists.\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = \"By Meg Gross | Source: RoadToNationals\") |&gt;\n  \n   tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow common are event specialists and all-around gymnasts?\n\n\nIn the top 4 NCAA men's gymnastics teams, there are a LOT of specialists.\n\n\nClassification\nCount\n\n\n\n\nAA\n7\n\n\nSpecialist\n42\n\n\n\nBy Meg Gross | Source: RoadToNationals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly enough, event specialists are incredibly common. Each NCAA team has at least two athletes per event that specialize in only that event, or at most one more. All-around gymnasts are much harder to find, but does that equate to value?\n\n\nCode\nggplot(averages, aes(x = Event, y = Average_Score, fill = Classification)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge()) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Specialist\" = \"lightblue\", \"AA\" = \"blue\")) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(9, 15)) +  \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(9, 15, by = 1)) +  \n  labs(y = \"Average Score\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"What kind of gymnast scores higher on each event, on average?\", \n    subtitle = \"Though there's not much of a difference, all-around gymnasts do typically score higher.\",\n    caption=\"Source: RoadToNationals | By Meg Gross\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, color = \"gray50\"),  \n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 10, color = \"gray60\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn average scoring per event, all-around and event specialist gymnasts are pretty evenly matched, but all-around gymnasts do barely edge on getting higher average scores on just over half of the six events – where specialists make it count is on horizontal bar and pommel horse.\nWhere event specialists are perceived to be absolute masters on their respective events, they more often match up evenly, and if not lower, than all-arounders.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(mgym, aes(x = Event, y = Event_Score, fill = Classification)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Specialist\" = \"lightblue\", \"AA\" = \"blue\")) +\n  labs(y = \"Event Score\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Focusing on score distributions tells a slightly different story.\", \n    subtitle = \"All-Around gymnasts tend to vary way more on each event.\",\n    caption=\"Source: RoadToNationals | By Meg Gross\")+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, color = \"gray50\"),  \n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 10, color = \"gray60\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what about score distributions? The box plot above shows how specialists might have the edge over all-around competitors on certain events, especially on the pommel horse. This begs the question, are all-arounders really more consistent?\nAll-around scores vary much more, as seen by the longer boxes, compared to event specialists, indicating that at least on an event-by-event basis, specialists are much more reliable.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(mgym, aes(x = Event, y = Contribution_Percentage, fill = Classification)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"summary\", fun = \"mean\", position = position_dodge()) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Specialist\" = \"lightblue\", \"AA\" = \"blue\")) +\n  labs(y = \"Contribution Percentage (%)\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Who is contributing more to their team's total per event?\", \n    subtitle = \"Average contributions remain pretty balanced across the board.\",\n    caption=\"Source: RoadToNationals | By Meg Gross\")+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, color = \"gray50\"),  \n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 10, color = \"gray60\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeither all-arounders nor specialists show clear dominance in boosting team performance on individual events.\nObviously, in the grand scheme of team scores, a pommel horse specialist with an flawless routine can’t possible contribute more in total than an all-around gymnast competing in six events for the team.\nWhile all-arounders might contribute slightly higher average scores and offer the consistency of competing across all events, specialists bring a focused precision that can give teams the edge in crucial meet-winning moments.\nBut when it comes to recruiting these gymnasts, the debate between event specialists and all-arounders maybe isn’t about choosing one over the other, but about recognizing their unique contributions. Specialists like Nedoroscik can deliver game-changing performances when it matters most, providing a level of reliability in high-stakes events like pommel horse. On the other hand, all-around gymnasts are indispensable for their versatility and consistency across multiple events, serving as the backbone of a team’s total score.\nWhether you’re recruiting for the next NCAA title or seeking a historic win on the biggest stage in sports, it’s not about choosing between specialists and all-arounders, but rather building a team where both types of gymnasts can thrive and contribute to their fullest potential."
